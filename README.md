# Resources related to social bias in machine learning, artificial intelligence and data science

The below resources are divided into two groups:
1. Sources for learning about problems of social bias related to ML/AI/DS
2. Guides/examples of how you can use ML/AI/DS to help identify and fight social bias

Much of this list is based on a presentation by Watson-in-the-Watt intern Cierra Oliveira; that presentation can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/109Tw0POt4w4itQ-Hznt7imSnHLF3t6VqPmoWun9UM-U)

# Resources related to social bias in machine learning, artificial intelligence and data science

The below resources are divided into two groups:
1. Sources for learning about problems of social bias related to ML/AI/DS
2. Guides/examples of how you can use ML/AI/DS to help identify and fight social bias

Much of this list is based on a presentation by Watson-in-the-Watt intern Cierra Oliveira; that presentation can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/109Tw0POt4w4itQ-Hznt7imSnHLF3t6VqPmoWun9UM-U)

## Sources describing problems of social bias

[Supposedly 'Fair' Algorithms Can Perpetuate Discrimination](https://www.wired.com/story/ideas-joi-ito-insurance-algorithms/): How the use of AI runs the risk of re-creating the insurance industry's inequities of the previous century. A look into how AI methods can wind up implementing 'redlining' techniques that disproportionately harm minority communities.

[Algorithmic bias detection and mitigation](https://www.brookings.edu/research/algorithmic-bias-detection-and-mitigation-best-practices-and-policies-to-reduce-consumer-harms/): Best practices and policies to reduce consumer harms. A very comprehensive article about algorithmic discrimination and techniques for avoiding it. Full of references to other useful sources.

[Machine Bias](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing): ProPublica's famous investigation discovering racial bias in AI used for making decisions related to bail and criminal sentencing. ![Image](images\pro_publica_compas.jpg)
